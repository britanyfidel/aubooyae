                            <p> First, I'd like to start by saying that I enjoyed Fallout 4 and it is a good game. I feel like I got my moneys worth. ampnbsp; That being said, it never felt like a proper fallout game and I originally assumed it was primarily because of the quest design choice. I went and started to compile all the quest for Fallout 2, New Vegas, and 4 and keep track of the type of quest they were and how many solutions they provided to make sure I didn't have Nostalgia glasses on. The results surprised. I have never played a fallout game but over the years everyone talks about them. So Steam had this one for sale for  and I picked it up. However upon starting the game, I received some what I think is fancy armor and weapons. I'm still very lost in the game but I don't want all this good stuff if its truly going to give me an unfair advantage in the start. What do you guys think about it? Will using the gear give me an unfair advantage or ruin the game? Edit: Thanks for the quick replies!. Skyrim has 60k lines of dialogue Fallout 4 has 110k Fallout 3, New Vegas and Oblivion all have less than Skyrim, so even if we were generous and said they all had 50k Even that wouldnt put all of them combined close to Red Dead 2 Even The Witcher 3 clocks in at 450k lines. I recently interviewed Chris Avellone on his 20+ years in the game industry, covering a variety of topics. Most of note here is Fallout 2, New Vegas and some of the carry over from Van Buren. Find the inverview here: http://roadmappodcast.com/podcast/26-chris-avellone-interview/. I am Radioaxive and I create let's plays a bit differently. Rather than having me shout at my computer and just constantly say how awesome the game I'm playing is, I play games where I attempt to embody the character I am playing. Address the world and the things that happen in it in real time, in the first person.

Great video about the areas of the American Southwest that the original games and New Vegas take place in. (https://youtu.be/89sOyZdtVA0). I‚Äôve played fallout 3, new Vegas ,and 4. So when I first went here I figured there would be some sort of monster in the water. Or the area since it‚Äôs near the edge of the map. Most of the other games kinda reward you for exploring the edges of the map with cool weapons, new or strong enemies, or cool lore/interactions. 
Bit of background: I'm a huge Fallout fan, New Vegas is one of my favorite games of all time, and I finally took it upon myself to play through the original games. I wasn't sure how well they'd hold up after playing the modern ones but I've been absolutely loving it so far! My only one gripe? The game tells you absolutely nothing about playing it. Now, I can't really fault the game (or the devs) for that, there's a manual that comes with the game (or at least with the Fixt mod), that I absolute. https://www.reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/6m9cux/neutrongtxs_igs_rep_page/ Already have the past couple humble monthly bundles. Make me an offer from one of their bundles or something different entirely Flair-Trade. I‚Äôve never played a Fallout game before, and I‚Äôd like a game that doesn‚Äôt take forever to complete or I can at least drop in and out of easily. I like shooting games and a good story. I‚Äôve been obsessed with the Fallout series ever since Fallout 3, New Vegas was amazing, and Fallout 4 was great but lacked something New Vegas and 3 had. I‚Äôm too scared to play 76 as I don‚Äôt want to be disappointed üòÇ My question is whether Fallout 1amp2 are worth playing? I‚Äôm a bit hesitant due to the birds eye view of everything. what‚Äôs the story and gameplay like compared to the new games? I‚Äôm hoping that because of the lack of graphics that there might be more time spent on the story. Happy to take a look at any offers. I'm also looking for 4 player games similar to Overcooked, Castle Crashers, and Super Mega Baseball. The Bards Tale BlazBlue: Chronophantasma Extend The Corporate Machine Crawl Dead Rising 2 Elder Scrolls: Legends: 2 Card Packs (Bathesda Key) Epistory ‚Äì Typing Chronicles F1 2011 F1 2012 Grey Goo Definitive Edition Hacknet with Labyrinths DLC Hand of Fate How to Survive 2 Hustle Cat The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing: Final Cut Kingdom:. The two final bosses of two of the biggest, baddest Fallout games in history slugging it out. I'm going to go through and see who I think has which advantages. Destruction: Legate Lannius has a naturally toxic blade, and can launch opponents off their feet in combat, but Frank Horrigan's Plasma Gun can break through Power Armor. In Melee combat, Lannius dominates with his sword about as tall as he is, but against Horrigan's Plasma Gun, he is comparably weak. Agility: Legate Lannius is faster. I am a lover of this game, and of fallout as a series. I have played from day one of the Beta up until I got to level 100, launched a nuke and have done many of the things the game had to offer. built up my melee tank in my X-01 power armor plus shocks etc. (standard 1st 3 month type character). I played almost exclusively solo except for a few random encounters. I have played fallout 3, new vegas and 4 countless times each. amp#x200B; Those of you who have dived back in/ started over/. Title says it all! Offers please! Comment before PM! Looking for newer games, but open to everything. Fallout 4 comes out with "creation club," costs  for a gun that New Vegas had in its vanilla game.
